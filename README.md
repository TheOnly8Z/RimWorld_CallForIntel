Desperate for a quest item? Itching for a bandit camp to fight? With this mod, you can call other factions to get quests at will!

## Functionality
After installing the mod, the comms console will have a new option - Request Intelligence. When calling an ally, you can use this option to choose between various types of quests/incidents.

There are currently these choices:
* Hostile activity (10 goodwill)
* Trading deals (15 goodwill)
* Locations of interest (15 goodwill)
* Refugees and slaves (25 goodwill)
* Legendary creatures (10 goodwill) (Only available at Viking factions in VFE-V)
* Bounties (10 goodwill) (Only available at Settler factions in VFE-S)

You will immediately receive a quest after choosing, but there will be a cooldown (shared with trade caravans).

## Compatibility
This mod is safe to add and remove mid-save and should be compatible with everything (including Raids For Me).

This mod doesn't require Royalty, and doesn't interfere with it. (I don't have Royalty and cannot test for it yet)

The following mods have integrated support:

### Vanilla Factions Expanded - Vikings
* Legendary graves and ancient dangers can be given as Locations of interest intel

### Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval
* Castle ruins and Tournament can be given as Locations of interest intel
### Go Explore

## Planned Features
* Configurable goodwill cost
